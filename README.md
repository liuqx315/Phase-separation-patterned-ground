This repository provides the OpenCL and Matlab codes that simulate the phase separation model 1 and model 2 on our manuscript. "Experimental Evidence for Phase Separation Organizing Patterned Ground" by Anyuan Li, Norikazu Matsuoka, Fujun Niu, Jing Chen, Zhenpeng Ge, Wensi Hu, Desheng Li, Bernard Hallet, Johan van de Koppel, Quan-Xing Liu (2020).
## guide for code 
Matlab fold includes the Matlab code on the derivation of potential function.
OpenCL fold includes the C++ code with cmake file to numerical results of self-organized patterns from Model 1 and Model 2 described in Supplementary Information.
