# Phase-separation-sorted-patterned-ground
This repository provides the OpenCL and Matlab codes that simulate phase separation model 1 and model 2 on our manuscript. "xx" by Anyuan Li, xxx, Quan-Xing Liu (2020).

Matlab fold includes the Matlab code on the derivation of potential function.
OpenCL fold includes the C++ code with cmake file to numerical results of self-organized patterns from Model 1 and Model 2 described in Supplementary Information.
