# Phase-separation-sorted-patterned-ground
This repository provides the OpenCL and Matlab codes that simulate the phase separation model 1 and model 2 on our manuscript. "Experimental Evidence for Phase Separation Organizing Patterned Ground" by Anyuan Li, Norikazu Matsuoka, Fujun Niu, Jing Chen, Zhenpeng Ge, Wensi Hu, Desheng Li, Bernard Hallet, Johan van de Koppel, Nigel Goldenfeld, and Quan-Xing Liu (2020).
## Guide for code 
* Matlab fold includes the Matlab code on the derivation of potential function.

* OpenCL fold includes the C++ code with cmake file to numerical results of self-organized patterns from Model 1 and Model 2 described in Supplementary Information. [OpenCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) is used as the computation engine, to take advantage of the spatial meshgrid on graphics cards and modern CPUs.

* R_code fold includes data statistical analyses and figures generated with RStudio.
## Code Availability 
The full codes and experimental data will be aviable once the original article acceptence. 

## Data availability
Where to obtain the data for the plot? We only keep the code here for convenience. The data about 2.5 GB will be available at the Zenodo repository (coming soon).
